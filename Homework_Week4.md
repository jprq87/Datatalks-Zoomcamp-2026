# Module 4 Homework: Analytics Engineering with dbt

In this homework, we'll use the dbt project in `04-analytics-engineering/taxi_rides_ny/` to transform NYC taxi data and answer questions by querying the models.

## Setup

1. Set up your dbt project following the [setup guide](../../../04-analytics-engineering/setup/)
2. Load the Green and Yellow taxi data for 2019-2020 into your warehouse
3. Run `dbt build --target prod` to create all models and run tests

> **Note:** By default, dbt uses the `dev` target. You must use `--target prod` to build the models in the production dataset, which is required for the homework queries below.

After a successful build, you should have models like `fct_trips`, `dim_zones`, and `fct_monthly_zone_revenue` in your warehouse.

---

### Question 1. dbt Lineage and Execution

Given a dbt project with the following structure:

```
models/
├── staging/
│   ├── stg_green_tripdata.sql
│   └── stg_yellow_tripdata.sql
└── intermediate/
    └── int_trips_unioned.sql (depends on stg_green_tripdata & stg_yellow_tripdata)
```

If you run `dbt run --select int_trips_unioned`, what models will be built?

- `int_trips_unioned` only

---

### Question 2. dbt Tests

You've configured a generic test like this in your `schema.yml`:

```yaml
columns:
  - name: payment_type
    data_tests:
      - accepted_values:
          arguments:
            values: [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
            quote: false
```

Your model `fct_trips` has been running successfully for months. A new value `6` now appears in the source data.

What happens when you run `dbt test --select fct_trips`?

- dbt will fail the test, returning a non-zero exit code

---

### Question 3. Counting Records in `fct_monthly_zone_revenue`

After running your dbt project, query the `fct_monthly_zone_revenue` model.

What is the count of records in the `fct_monthly_zone_revenue` model?

```
SELECT COUNT(*) 
FROM `de-zoomcamp-week4-487602.dbt_jprq.fct_monthly_zone_revenue`
```

- 12,184

---

### Question 4. Best Performing Zone for Green Taxis (2020)

Using the `fct_monthly_zone_revenue` table, find the pickup zone with the **highest total revenue** (`revenue_monthly_total_amount`) for **Green** taxi trips in 2020.

Which zone had the highest revenue?

```
SELECT 
    pickup_zone,
    SUM(revenue_monthly_total_amount) AS total_revenue_2020
FROM `de-zoomcamp-week4-487602.dbt_jprq.fct_monthly_zone_revenue`
WHERE service_type = 'Green'
  AND EXTRACT(YEAR FROM revenue_month) = 2020
GROUP BY pickup_zone
ORDER BY total_revenue_2020 DESC
LIMIT 1;
```

- East Harlem North

---

### Question 5. Green Taxi Trip Counts (October 2019)

Using the `fct_monthly_zone_revenue` table, what is the **total number of trips** (`total_monthly_trips`) for Green taxis in October 2019?

```
SELECT 
    SUM(total_monthly_trips)
FROM `de-zoomcamp-week4-487602.dbt_jprq.fct_monthly_zone_revenue`
WHERE 
    service_type = 'Green'
    AND revenue_month = '2019-10-01'
```

- 384,624

---

### Question 6. Build a Staging Model for FHV Data

Create a staging model for the **For-Hire Vehicle (FHV)** trip data for 2019.

1. Load the [FHV trip data for 2019](https://github.com/DataTalksClub/nyc-tlc-data/releases/tag/fhv) into your data warehouse
2. Create a staging model `stg_fhv_tripdata` with these requirements:
   - Filter out records where `dispatching_base_num IS NULL`
   - Rename fields to match your project's naming conventions (e.g., `PUlocationID` → `pickup_location_id`)

What is the count of records in `stg_fhv_tripdata`?

```
with source as (
    select * from {{ source('nytaxi', 'fhv_tripdata') }}
),

renamed as (
    select
        -- identifiers
        cast(dispatching_base_num as string) as dispatching_base_number,
        cast(affiliated_base_number as string) as affiliated_base_number,
        cast(pulocationid as integer) as  pickup_location_id,
        cast(dolocationid as integer) as dropoff_location_id,

        -- timestamps
        cast(pickup_datetime as timestamp) as pickup_datetime,
        cast(dropoff_datetime as timestamp) as dropoff_datetime,

        -- trip info
        cast(sr_flag as string) as sr_flag

    from source
    -- Filter out records with null dispatching_base_num
    where dispatching_base_num is not null
)

select * from renamed

-- Sample records for dev environment using deterministic date filter
{% if target.name == 'dev' %}
where pickup_datetime >= '2019-01-01'
  and pickup_datetime < '2019-02-01'
{% endif %}
```
